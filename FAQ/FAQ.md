# Frequently Asked Questions Section
This file will contain updated grouping of commonly asked questions with regards to Python and statistics. 

# Getting Started - 

## I'm new! Where do I begin?
 - If you are new to programming or new to Python: I reccomend going through each lab in the order it is presented. Lab 1 and beyond. Each one builds off the other. Go ahead and download the whole repository and work through it at the pace that feels right. I reccomend weekly lab time just so that it stays fresh! You can get Python for FREE through either through the Canopy or the Anaconda distribution. The labs were made and tested with the Anaconda distribution. 

## I'm here to learn Python but code in space science / climate science. Where do I begin?
- Lab 1 has a lot of what you need to get started. Begin there then pick and choose what labs you would like after that but make sure to start with Lab 1 as it has a lot of the basics of Python oddities in there. 

## I'm here from space science and I've heard talk about SpacePy, astroPy, SunPy etc?
- Go check out the Python in Heliophysics community pages and projects at https://heliopython.org/projects/.

## How do vmin, vmax, and set_under() work together?
- vmin and vmax set the scale of the colorbar, whereas set_under() sets all the values under the scale to the color that you specify. If vmin is set to the lowest value in the data you are plotting, then set_under() has no effect.
