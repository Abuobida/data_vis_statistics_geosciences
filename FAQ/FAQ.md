# Frequently Asked Questions Section
This file will contain updated grouping of commonly asked questions with regards to Python and statistics. 

# Getting Started - 

<details>
 <summary> 
  I'm new! Where do I begin?
 </summary>

 - If you are new to programming or new to Python: I reccomend going through each lab in the order it is presented. Lab 1 and beyond. Each one builds off the other. 
 - Go ahead and download the whole repository and work through it at the pace that feels right. I reccomend weekly lab time just so that it stays fresh! You can get Python for FREE through either through the Canopy or the Anaconda distribution. The labs were made and tested with the Anaconda distribution. 
- This is a course at the University of Michigan. If you are currently at UM, check out the course number Climate and Space 405 - 002 (To Be Updated as of 2018 to finalized course number)

  I'm here to learn Python but code in space science / climate science. Where do I begin?
 </summary>
 
- Lab 1 has a lot of what you need to get started. Begin there then pick and choose what labs you would like after that but make sure to start with Lab 1 as it has a lot of the basics of Python oddities in there.

 <summary> 
  I'm at the University of Michigan and want to see what other classes there are around?
 </summary>
 
- This class is a good place to start at the upper level undergrad / graduate level on statistics and data analysis in Python. Below I list similar level classes with a different focus as well as follow on classes that are at more advanced levels. I also reccomend checking out the MIDAS certificate approved courses [here](https://midas.umich.edu/certificate/approved-courses/).

   <details>
    <summary> 
      Similar level courses with a different flavor: 
    </summary>
 
    - STATS 412 Introduction to Probability & Statistics -- More theory based and introductory stats
    - STATS 451 Bayesian Data Analysis -- Less visualization, more theory, more Bayesian

      More advanced courses:
     </summary>

    - EECS 545 Machine Learning 
    - EECS 598 Computational Data Science

<details>
  <summary> I'm here from space science and I've heard talk about SpacePy, astroPy, SunPy etc?
  </summary>
- Go check out the Python in Heliophysics community pages and projects at https://heliopython.org/projects/.

# Lab 1 Questions

# Lab 2 Questions

# Lab 3 Questions
<details>
 <summary> 
  How do vmin, vmax, and set_under() work together?
 </summary>
 
- vmin and vmax set the scale of the colorbar, whereas set_under() sets all the values under the scale to the color that you specify. If vmin is set to the lowest value in the data you are plotting, then set_under() has no effect. 
</details>


# Visualizations 
<details>
 <summary> 
  I just want a quick way to tell if my figure is understandable by many people?
 </summary>
 
- Go check out the [visualization lectures](https://github.com/astro-abby/data_vis_statistics_geosciences/tree/master/VisualizationBasics). This is a quick tool that you can install to see if your figures are readable for the various types of colors that people see - [Color Oracle](https://colororacle.org/)
