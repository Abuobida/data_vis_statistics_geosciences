# data_vis_statistics_geosciences
This repository contains the laboratory portion of an upper level undergraduate class in Python on data visualization and 
statistics for geo &amp; space scientists. Labs will be updated from January - May at the same cadence as the course.

The labs uploaded will be in Jupyter primarily and coded in Python 3.5+. However, most of the functions and methods should work in Python 2.7. If you do not have/know what Jupyter is - you can download Python/Jupyter from Anaconda or Canopy as a fully installed and interactive environment. This will support most if not all of the packages used in the labs and then you can navigate to Jupyter through Anaconda/Canopy.
