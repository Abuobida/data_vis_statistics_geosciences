# data_vis_statistics_geosciences
This repository contains the laboratory portion of an upper level undergraduate class in Python on data visualization and 
statistics for geo &amp; space scientists. Labs will be updated from January - May at the same cadence as the course.

The labs uploaded will be in Jupyter primarily and coded in Python 3.5+. However, most of the functions and methods should work in Python 2.7. If you do not have/know what Jupyter is - you can download Python/Jupyter from Anaconda or Canopy as a fully installed and interactive environment. This will support most if not all of the packages used in the labs and then you can navigate to Jupyter through Anaconda/Canopy.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Note: For the error analysis section there are equations written in LaTeX. They do not show up well with Github's preview - if you want to view these please download the Jupyter notebook.

This README will be updated to reflect current changes. Data used in the lessons will be accredited to the providers. Lab assignments are availiable and will be mentioned in the tutorials but are not as of (1/9/2018) linked. 

Discussions with climate scientist [Samantha Basile](http://clasp.engin.umich.edu/people/sjbasile/GSTUDENT) were critical in developing these materials. We also thank planetary scientist [Camilla Harris](https://github.com/cdkharris) for discussions of Juno data.
