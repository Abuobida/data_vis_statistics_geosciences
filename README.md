# data_vis_statistics_geosciences
This repository contains the laboratory portion of an upper level undergraduate class in Python on data visualization and 
statistics for geo &amp; space scientists. Labs will be updated from January - May at the same cadence as the course.

The labs uploaded will be in Jupyter primarily and coded in Python 3.5. However, most of the functions and methods should work in Python 2.7. 

Lab 1 - Intro to Python - What IS Pandas? (1/10/2018)
      - Temperature Changes: Looking at Global Temperature Variances in the Last Century
Lab 2 - Multi-plots and Datetime Objects (1/17/2018)
      - Ecosystem Impacts: Looking at Audubon Society Data on Bird Wintering Patterns 


This README will be updated to reflect current changes. Data used in the lessons will be accredited to the providers. Lab assignments are availiable and will be mentioned in the tutorials but are not as of (1/9/2018) linked.
