    <p>
    	<ol>
		    		    	<li><p>Data obtained from Multiple Cause Mortality files provided by CDC's National Center for Health Statistics.</p></li>
					    	<li><p>Deaths from excessive heat exposure are defined based on codes from the tenth revision of International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). Such deaths included those in which exposure to excessive natural heat (code X30) was reported as either the underlying or a contributing cause of death. Deaths due to exposure to excessive heat of man-made origin (W92) were excluded</p></li>
					    	<li><p>Geographic differences in the data may be due to variations in death investigation laws, the classification of deaths, and the degree to which heat deaths are recognized by the medical examiner/coroner/physician.</p></li>
					    	<li><p>Only deaths that occurred in the summer months (May- September) are included in the calculation of this measure.</p></li>
					    	<li><p>Data are suppressed if the number of deaths is less than 10 (including 0).</p></li>

            <h3>Blanks or Missing Data</h3>
        <p>Blanks or missing data within the maps, tables, and charts may be due to one of the following reasons: (1) data were not collected, (2) data were collected but were not provided to CDC, or (3) data were incomplete or did not meet data quality standards.</p>

            <h3>Data Differences</h3>
        <p>Data presented on CDC's Tracking Network may differ from data that are presented on state or city tracking networks, state or city health department websites, and other source websites for the same measures. The differences may occur for many reasons, such as use of different population estimates, differences in processes and timing for updating data, or differences in how a measure is defined for environmental public health tracking purposes. Consult the indicators and measures descriptions and metadata that are provided on this site for more information.</p>

  <h3>Why was the data set created?</h3>
  <div>
	<b><p>Purpose</p></b>
	<p><ul><li>Identify populations and target areas that are vulnerable or at high risk for heat-associated death</li><li>Allow a better understanding of spatial and temporal trends of heat-related mortality.</li><li>Allow comparison across states; such comparisons can be used to deliver interventions.</li></ul></p>

  <h3>How was the data set created?</h3>
  <div>
	<b><p>Derivation of measure</p></b>
	<p>Nationally derived by CDC's Environmental Health Tracking Branch using National Center for Health Statistics mortality data with appropriate ICD-10 codes to calculate the total number of deaths by year during summer (May - September) period, by year. Deaths from excessive heat exposure are defined based on codes from the tenth revision of International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10). Such deaths included those in which exposure to excessive natural heat (code X30) was reported as either the underlying or a contributing cause of death. Deaths due to exposure to excessive heat of man-made origin (W92) were excluded.</p>
  </div>
  <h3>What are the limitations of the data set?</h3>
  <div>
  	<b><p></p></b>
	<p>Mortality data - data may not provide all information related to cause of death.</p>
  </div>
  <h3>How should these data be used?</h3>
  <div>
	<b><p>Use Constraints</p></b>
	<p>Death can be attributed to other causes rather than solely from heat.</p>
  </div>
